# HyperFast-ReadMe
This app helps you generate a ReadMe, HyperFast.

## HyperFast

Welcome to the HyperFast ReadMe Generator! 

If you're looking to start a new project, or finishing one up and need a ReadMe fast, this was created for you. It is as simple as answering some questions in Node.js, and your ReadMe is rapidly generated right before your eyes. The ReadMe comes out looking high-class, with detailed descriptions and headers, links to your github account, and everything you could ever need or imagine in a ReadMe. 

Thanks for stopping in! I look forward to working together to make the present and future a better place.
